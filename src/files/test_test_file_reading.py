"""Reading and Writing Files

@see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files

The process of reading and writing to a file is like finding a book and opening a book.
First, the file is located, opened to the first page, then reading/writing begins until it reaches
the end of the file.

def test_files_open():
    """Open files

    open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments:
    open(filename, mode).

    The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string
    containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be:

    - 'r' when the file will only be read,
    - 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),
    - 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to end.
    - 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.

    The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.
